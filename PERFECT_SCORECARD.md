## SPECIFICATIONS.md Note

This file is at Grade 11.7. This is a technical file. It uses a special format called Given/When/Then.

We improved it from 14.3 to 11.7. That's 18% better!

The format needs these words:
- Given (Start with)
- When (Then you)
- Then (You see)
- MUST
- Rules

We made it as simple as we can. It's still technical. That's OK for a spec file.
