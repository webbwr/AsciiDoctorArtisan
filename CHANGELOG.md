# What Changed

This tells what we did.

## Next Update (Not Out Yet)

We added PDF files. You can open them now. We made tests to check PDFs work. All tests pass!

Settings work better. The window size saves. The font size saves too.

We took out the AI helper. We don't need it. This makes the program simpler.

We need a new tool called pdfplumber. We don't need some old tools now.

We fixed how settings save. Everything saves right now.

The code is cleaner. It fits our plan better. We have 14 tests. They all work!
