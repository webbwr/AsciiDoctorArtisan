## Why Archived

**Completion:** All Phase 4C and 4E coverage goals achieved:
- Core modules at 99-100% coverage
- Workers at 93-100% coverage (limited by Qt threading)
- UI modules at 84-100% coverage
- 204/204 tests passing (100% pass rate)

- Coverage targets met or exceeded
- Edge cases identified and tested
- Hanging tests documented with workarounds
- Test suite stabilized and optimized

**Documentation:** Coverage work documented in active references:
- test-coverage.md - Current metrics and patterns
- ROADMAP.md v2.0.4 - Coverage achievement summary
- TEST_ISSUES_SUMMARY.md - Complete test health report
